# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. Here we are helping one of the companies BoomBikes who work on this

## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

So they want to understand how the demand of bike rentals is getting affected. Which factors are affecting the rentals mostly and are they affected in a positive way or negative way.

To solve this we have implemented a model using multiple linear regression, which helps in seeing the number of bikes that got rented on different variables like temp, month, year.


## Conclusions
Demand of rental bikes are mostly dependent on:
-  Year
-  Temperature
-  Season (Spring, Summer, Winter)
-  Months (July, September)
-  Climate (Misty, Light snow with Rain)
-  Weekday (Tuesday)
